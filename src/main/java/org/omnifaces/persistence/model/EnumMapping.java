/**
 * Basic annotation to change default behaviour of <code>@Enumerated</code>.
 * When this annotation is added to the declaration of declaration of custom
 * <code>enum</code> then persisting its value by using <code>@Enumerated</code>
 * will be changed. If {@link EnumType#ORDINAL} is used as {@link #type}
 * (default) then the enum will be persisted basing on {@link #fieldName} that's
 * holding custom state of <code>enum</code> that must correspond to the real
 * property of <code>enum</code> and must be of <code>int</code> type, otherwise
 * default mapping will be applied. If {@link EnumType#STRING} is used as
 * {@link #type} then the enum will be persisted basing on {@link #fieldName}
 * that must correspond to the real property of <code>enum</code> and must be of
 * <code>String</code> type, otherwise default mapping will be applied. The
 * {@link #fieldName} defaults to <code>"id"</code> when {@link #type} evaluates
 * to {@link EnumType#ORDINAL} and to <code>"code"</code> when {@link #type}
 * evaluates to {@link EnumType#STRING}.
 * <p>
 * Modified behaviour of <code>@Enumerated</code> will be used when the entities
 * are managed by {@link BaseEntityService}. Noted should be that when any
 * entity managed by {@link BaseEntityService} uses the <code>enum</code> with
 * {@link EnumMapping} applied then it will be persisted in a modified way way
 * even when the other entity is not managed by {@link BaseEntityService} to
 * entail consistency.
 * <p>
 * This is particularly useful if you want to avoid drawbacks of standard JPA
 * enum mappings, like reordering or renaming, by enforcing consistency between
 * enum modifications during application development, like addition of new, or
 * removal of old enum values. By using this annotation developer has full
 * control of what part of the enum will be mapped to the database.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage of this annotation is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *{@literal @}EnumMapping(fieldName = "id")
 * public enum ProductStatus {
 *
 *     IN_STOCK(1), OUT_OF_STOCK(10), DISCONTINUED(20);
 *
 *     private int id;
 *
 *     private ProductStatus(int id) {
 *         this.id = id;
 *     }
 *
 *     public int getId() {
 *         return id;
 *     }
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * and
 * <pre>
 *{@literal @}EnumMapping(type = EnumType.STRING, fieldName = "code")
 * public enum UserRole {
 *
 *     USER("USR"), EMPLOYEE("EMP"), MANAGER("MGR");
 *
 *     private String code;
 *
 *     private UserRole(String code) {
 *         this.code = code;
 *     }
 *
 *     public String getCode() {
 *         return code;
 *     }
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * with
 * <pre>
 *{@literal @}Entity
 * public class Product extends GeneratedIdEntity&lt;Long&gt; {
 *
 *     {@literal @}Enumerated
 *     private ProductStatus productStatus;
 *
 *     {@literal @}ElementCollection
 *     {@literal @}Enumerated(STRING)
 *     private Set&lt;UserRole&gt; userRoles = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
 *
 *     // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * In such setup persistence provider will save to the database the status as
 * either 1, 10 or 20 (as opposed to 0, 1 or 2) and role as either USR, EMP or
 * MGR (as opposed to USER, EMPLOYEE or MANAGER).
 *
 * <p>
 * The behaviour described above allows to change the way that enums are
 * persisted, thus making persistence of enums steadier than by default, but it
 * doesn't allow to keep all possible enum values in a separate database table,
 * nor it allows to differentiate between discontinued enum values that were
 * used in the past, but are not now supported. By using the additional
 * {@link EnumMappingTable} annotation the correspondence between java enum and
 * database table representations can be established and enum mapping can be
 * fine-tuned.
 * <p>
 * When using this annotation the default mapping can be changed and one-to-one
 * correspondence between java enum and database table representations can be
 * achieved, with the additional possibility to track historical values of enum
 * constants used before. By default this behaviour is turned off, as it
 * requires developer to specify the additional enum mapping characteristics,
 * and the standard enum mapping specified with this annotation is applied.
